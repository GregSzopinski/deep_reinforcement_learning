# deep_reinforcement_learning
Implementations of popular RL algorithms with deep learning as a function estimation method.
* REINFORCE  - minimal and self-contained implementation of REINFORCE - classic RL algorithm introduced by R.J. Williams
* tic-tac-toe - custom environment to test various RL algorithms in solving this classic game. 
This solution is highly inspired by https://github.com/MJeremy2017/Reinforcement-Learning-Implementation/blob/master/TicTacToe/ticTacToe.py
There are still some elements to improve (e.g. better interface, generalization, etc.)
* open_ai_gym - examples from OpenAI's gym (classic problems, optimal control, atari games etc.)
